            <h2>Can esports / gaming websites benefit from SEO?</h2>
            <p>For anyone reading this who are unfamiliar with “esports” it is a term referring to the competitive side of video games. With tournaments awarding prize pools up to as much of $24.7 million every year, often with a wide range of smaller yet still noticeably grand prizes for the winners happening most months it is a flourishing and growing market.</p>
            <p>Like most owners of business and personal websites, who want their website to be visited and engaged with by more users, esports teams, organisations and content websites want the same. With their goal to reach a wider audience than they already are ranking highly in search engines can really help them to be found by and capture the attention of potential fans and returning users. Although we understand that often SEO will rightfully not be as important as achieving higher results in the tournaments you compete in, it can really help focus attention of producing a better website and content that you can benefit from.</p>

            <h2>What results can we promise</h2>
            <p>
              Honestly, with SEO we feel it takes a great deal of experience to promise guaranteed SEO results for every business that you work with to get the results they really want. What we can promise is that while optimising your website it will gradually improve on it’s own merits which means it will be ready to tackle any search engine changes. Many other companies often utilise black hat techniques which in the short term provide results but aren't good in the long term for any SEO campaign, we promise to create stability and results that will work over the long term and won’t have your website flagged or filtered from results.</p>

            <h2>Reporting on the results</h2>
            <p>
              We understand that if you haven’t experienced SEO and the process before it may be worrying or confusing that after the first changes have been made to the website and you search on Google for your business that it isn’t the first or even on the second page of results. Patience is key as the search engine slowly moves your website up the rankings, from experience a website that slowly gets to the top of the results often has a far better chance of staying there for a longer period. Many online SEO guru’s will offer a service that gets you to the top quickly only for the search engine to blacklist the website or reposition it back to where it started. You can expect within the reporting to see a slow and steady approach where ground is being covered towards the best outcome for each client.</p>
