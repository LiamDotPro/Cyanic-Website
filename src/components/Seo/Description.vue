          <h2>Where do we offer our SEO Services?</h2>
          <p>Similar to a lot of other agencies and search engine optimisers we don’t just offer “SEO Derby” or “SEO Reading”. Although members of our team are based in Derby and Reading we aren’t  limited to helping websites specifically in those areas. As we are a small, currently two person, remote team we are already adapt and experienced with working with clients all over the UK. The effectiveness of the SEO work we complete isn’t affected by location as it is the same search engine algorithm determining the website’s ranking for the respective keywords; the only difference is in that there will be varying competition for keywords in different locations. </p>
          <p>However, if locally there are a lot of businesses competing for similar or the same keywords you can still with our help rise above those who are less engaged or that have neglected the search engine optimisation of their website. Although we are not against it we don’t visit every client’s physical business locations, we instead work with clients remotely (via the most convenient form of communication for them) as we are a small team and want all clients to benefit from our cost efficiency.</p>

          <h2>What is SEO and how do we approach it?</h2>
          <p>Search Engine Optimisation, often referred to as SEO is the process of changing both “on page” and “off page” factors that influence how highly search engine’s (Google, Bing, etc.) value the content when users search for specific keywords.</p>
          <p>If not familiar with SEO “on page” factors relate to changing / improving the structure and content of the website’s pages to make it more appropriate to answer the questions the search engine users are asking. On page SEO is the majority of the work that we will do for you when you chose us to optimise your website. We understand that a lot of agencies and other search engine optimisers will claim to offer a wider offering, however, we understand that you can achieve great ranking results by primarily focusing on the part of SEO that you have the most control over. With better content, structure and visibility to the search engines your website will look and be more appealing to both users and other websites that may want to link to your site as a reference.</p>
          <p>Having your website linked to from external websites is an area of SEO commonly referred to as “off page SEO” that includes “backlinking”, “outreach” and “directory listings”. We don’t claim to be experienced at the actions of approaching or enticing highly (or better) ranking websites than our client’s for the purpose of creating a backlink and positively enhancing their website’s ranking. </p>

          <h2>What does the SEO work involve?</h2>
          <p>An overview of the work (and expectant order of actions) involved in the search engine optimisation process we follow includes:</p>
          <h3>Initial Setup</h3>
          <p>Every website (that hasn’t had SEO work done before) starts off by enabling and installing tools to monitor/identify the current state and going forward the progress of the website’s keyword ranking. These tools allow a clearer view of how the changes made to the website have impacted the SEO as well as the subsequent benefits of doing so (e.g. increased visitors). With this we are also more than willing to help the website owners become familiar with using these tools to give them the ability to review the site themselves during and after we are working on it with them.  </p>
